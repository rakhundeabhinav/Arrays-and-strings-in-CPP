# 🧪 Experiment 7: Arrays and Strings in C++

## 🔍 About

This experiment introduces the use of **arrays** and **strings** in C++, focusing on basic operations like reversal, traversal, and manipulation.

---

## 📌 Aim

To study and implement various operations on arrays and strings using C++ programming.

---

## 📚 Theory

* **Arrays** are used to store multiple values of the same type in contiguous memory locations.
* **Strings** in C++ are sequences of characters, handled using `char` arrays or the `string` class.
* Common operations like reversing, summing, and concatenation are often used in data processing and logic development.

## 📑 List of Programs with Descriptions and Algorithms

---

### 🔁 1. Reverse Array

**Description:** Reverses the elements of a given array.
**Algorithm:**

1. Input size `n` and array elements.
2. Use a loop to print elements from `n-1` to `0`.

---

### ➕ 2. Sum and Average of Array

**Description:** Calculates the sum and average of array elements.
**Algorithm:**

1. Input size `n` and array elements.
2. Initialize `sum = 0`.
3. Loop through the array and add each element to `sum`.
4. Calculate `average = sum / n`.

---

### 🔍 3. Minimum and Maximum in Array

**Description:** Finds the smallest and largest numbers in an array.
**Algorithm:**

1. Input size `n` and array elements.
2. Initialize `min` and `max` to first element.
3. Loop through the array:

   * If element < `min`, update `min`.
   * If element > `max`, update `max`.

### 🔄 4. Reverse String

**Description:** Reverses a string entered by the user.
**Algorithm:**

1. Input the string.
2. Find its length.
3. Print characters from last index to first using a loop.

---

### 🔗 5. Concatenate Two Strings

**Description:** Joins two strings into one.
**Algorithm:**

1. Input two strings.
2. Use `+` operator (for `string` type) or `strcat()` (for `char` arrays).
3. Print the combined string.

---
### 🔁 7. Palindrome Check (String)

**Description**: Checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads same forward and backward).
**Algorithm:**

1.Input string.

2.Reverse the string.

3.Compare original and reversed strings.

4.If equal, it's a palindrome.

## ✅ Conclusion

This experiment helped me understand the fundamentals of **array and string manipulation** in C++. By writing and testing basic programs, I learned how to perform common operations like reversing, finding min/max, concatenation, and user input handling using both arrays and strings.
